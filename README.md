# Research_ELM
Objective • To develop a novel Multi-layer Extreme Learning Machine to enhance performance for classification tasks
Approach
• Built a multi-layer ELM with local receptive fields in the first hidden layer for localized feature extraction
• Applied small-world sparse connectivity in deeper layers to maintain network expressiveness and efficiency
• Introduced new long-range connections across non-adjacent layers to enhance inter-layer connectivity
Result • Achieved stable increase in accuracy and generalization across multiple datasets, improving accuracy traditional
ELM model (MNIST: 93.27% to 97.52%, Fashion-MNIST: 84.42% to 88.70%, K-MNIST: 70.07% to 85.21%)


final_MELM consists the final model code for subsequent datasets
